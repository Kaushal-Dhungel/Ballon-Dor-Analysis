# Ballon D'or Dataset Analysis.
*Karim Benzema won the Ballon d'Or award this year without any controversy. However, there have been numerous debates surrounding this award in the past, raising concerns about its legitimacy. Here, I have tried to visualize Ballon d'Or dataset using Python. The Dataset wasn't complete and the nationlaity of the players wasn't given as well. Hence, I had to scrape, transform and preprocess the data before it was ready for visualisation.*

## I tried to do the following analysis:-

**1. Most Wins by Club and Top 3 Representation( Top 7 Clubs).**

![wins and top3](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Ballon-Dor-Analysis/blob/main/figures/1.png)

*-With Benzema's win this year, Real Madrid's players have won the award twelve times, matching Barcelona's record. However, in terms of top three finishes, Barcelona(34) still edges Real Madrid (27).*


**2. Most No. of Winners By Club.**

![winners by club](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Ballon-Dor-Analysis/blob/main/figures/2.png)

*- Real Madrid have had eight different winners followed by AC Milan, Juventus, and Barcelona (6 each).*


**3. Most No. of Winners By Country.**

*- This is a list of players who have finished in the top three at least twice but have never won the award. Xavi and Schuster are at the top of the list, having finished in the top three on three different occasions.*


**7. Winners With Highest Vote Percentage (2022 Not Included)**

![highest vote percentage](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Ballon-Dor-Analysis/blob/main/figures/7.png)

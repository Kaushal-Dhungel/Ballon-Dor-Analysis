# Ballon D'or Dataset Analysis.
*Since, Karim Benzema recently won his first Ballon D'or, I tried analysing the Ballon D'Or Dataset. The Dataset wasn't complete and the nationlaity of the players wasn't given as well. Hence, I had to augument the data.*

## I tried to do the following analysis:-

**1. Most Wins by Club and Top 3 Representation( Top 7 Clubs).**
